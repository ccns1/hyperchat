EXPERIMENTAL

Testing out p2p video chat, built on dat. Drawing from [hypercast](https://github.com/louiscenter/hypercast).

Basics seem to work, not super stable, but there is a consistent 5s lag on incoming streams, not sure why

# To Do

- performance improvements
- rooms (synchronizing peer lists)
- chat
- muting
- screensharing (currently doesn't seem to be any standard web API for doing so)
